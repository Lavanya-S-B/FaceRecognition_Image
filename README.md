# Image-Based Face Recognition System

This project implements a simple **face recognition system** using Python. It can recognize faces from images using the `face_recognition` and `OpenCV` libraries.

---

## Features

- Detects and recognizes faces from images.
- Supports multiple known faces for training.
- Outputs images with recognized faces labeled.

---
## Usage

- Train images: Place images of people you want to recognize in the train folder. Each image should contain one face.

- Test images: Place images to test recognition in the test folder.

- Run the project: **python main.py**


- Output: The program will generate labeled output images in the project folder (e.g., output_test1.jpg, output_test2.jpg).


---

## Notes

- Ensure training images are clear and faces are frontal for better recognition.

- Multiple test images can be added to the test folder for batch recognition.
